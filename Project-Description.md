🌍 **Exploring Climate Dynamics: Investigating Extreme Weather Patterns**

I'm thrilled to announce an exciting summer research opportunity that I'll be embarking on with Met Éireann, focusing on climate simulations of extreme weather phenomena, including the infamous "Beast from the East". 🌬️ Our mission is to delve into the potential impacts of these events under different global warming scenarios, aiming to illuminate the real-world effects of climate change on our local communities.

🔬 **Research Approach**: Leveraging access to supercomputer resources at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, I'll be employing the cutting-edge regional climate model HCLIM. This enables us to run detailed simulations, providing insights into how extreme weather events may evolve in a changing climate.

📊 **Focus on Ireland**: Our research fills a crucial gap in the literature by focusing on Ireland, utilizing high-resolution local climate models. By narrowing our scope, we aim to provide nuanced insights into how recent extreme events could exacerbate under global warming scenarios.

🌱 **Scientific Outreach**: Beyond scientific inquiry, we're committed to impactful outreach efforts. Through our findings, we aspire to enhance public understanding of climate change and its implications. By illustrating the potential consequences of extreme weather events, we aim to foster informed decision-making and promote proactive mitigation strategies.

Special thanks to my supervisor, Tido Semmler, for his invaluable guidance and support throughout this exciting endeavor! 🙏
